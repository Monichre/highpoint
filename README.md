    analyze Analyze all relevant files in the current working directory. All engines that are enabled in your .codeclimate.yml file will run, one after another. The -f (or format) argument allows you to set the output format of the analysis (using json, text, or html). The --dev flag lets you run engines not known to the CLI, for example if you're an engine author developing your own, unreleased image.

You can optionally provide a specific path to analyze. If not provided, the CLI will analyze your entire repository, except for your configured exclude_paths. When you do provide an explicit path to analyze, your configured exclude_paths are ignored, and normally excluded files will be analyzed.

You can also pipe in source in combination with a path to analyze code that is not yet written to disk. This is useful when you want to check if your source code style matches the project's. This is also a good way to implement integration with an editor to check style on the fly.

console start an interactive session providing access to the classes within the CLI. Useful for engine developers and maintainers.

engines:install Compares the list of engines in your .codeclimate.yml file to those that are currently installed, then installs any missing engines.

engines:list Lists all available engines in the Code Climate Docker Hub .

help Displays a list of commands that can be passed to the Code Climate CLI.

validate-config Validates the .codeclimate.yml file in the current working directory.

version Displays the current version of the Code Climate CLI.
