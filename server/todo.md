# Homepage

- 1. We would like to see 2 versions of the homepage (keeping the bones as we are very happy with the general look and feel, but have two ideas we would like to see executed):

Version 1 = Keep the video within the frame of the black lines with the Highpoint logo in white (we also loved out how it sketched out and would like to keep this feature)
Version 2 = Keep the homepage entirely as is.  We still love the concept of seeing the video through the Highpoint logo, and understand the restrictions.  However, we would like to see a version where if you hover the mouse over the logo, it changes into an icon identifying that if you click on the logo, you can now watch the video.  Once you click the logo, the video would populate into the frame (same way as mentioned in version 1 unless there’s a better way).  The logo would either go away entirely or better yet, move to the left corner where the search bar currently lives.
 

We would like the H in the top corner to also be the link to the homepage.
 

# Portfolio

- 1. When scrolling down, we would like if we could see one postcard at a time instead of looking at the bottom half of the postcard above it when scrolling.  If there is a way to jump from one postcard to the next so you’re not in a weird, in between space, that would be ideal.
We wanted to confirm, if you click on the picture of each property in the portfolio, can it take you directly to the corresponding process page for that address?  (i.e. you click on the picture of The Niles and it goes directly to the process page for The Niles – same for each property)
 

# Process

Also want to confirm, we are definitely building out a process for each property at this point?  We know we provided you with a lot of data the other day, we just want to make sure we’re all on the same page here.
